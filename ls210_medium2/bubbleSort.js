/**
 * 'Bubble Sort' is one of the simplest sorting algorithms available. Although it is not an efficient algorithm,
 * it is an excellent exercise for student developers. In this exercise, you will write a function that sorts an
 * array using the bubble sort algorithm.
 *
 * A bubble sort works by making multiple passes (iterations) through an array. On each pass, the two values of
 * each pair of consecutive elements are compared. If the first value is greater than the second, the two
 * elements are swapped. This process is repeated until a complete pass is made without performing any swaps â€” at
 * which point the array is completely sorted.
 *
 * Data Structures:
 *  Input: array
 *  Output: undefined
 *  In-between: array
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  1. Iterate until no swaps occur
 *     - Compare two values
 *       - If val1 < val2, continue
 *       - If val1 > val2, swap values
 *  2. Return
